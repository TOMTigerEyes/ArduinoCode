# ArduinoCode
The Arduino code for controlling the joystick and the buttons
The code will only work on Arduino Leonardo or equivalent. It
will not work on Arduino Uno because it does not support the 
mouse and keyboard libraries. 

For other boards that support these libraries, please double
check the pin configurations.
